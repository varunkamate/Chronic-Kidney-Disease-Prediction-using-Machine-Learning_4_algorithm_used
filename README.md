# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning_4_algorithm_used

ðŸ§  Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
A machine learning-based solution to predict the presence of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using a structured dataset. This project utilizes 4 different classification algorithms to evaluate model performance and identify the best predictive model.
